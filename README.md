## Reaction Speed Challenge

### Introduction

Reaction Times are important, such tests may be implemented for staff to ensure employees are fit for certain tasks such as driving, machine operation etc.
This presents an opportunity for gamification of a reaction test!

For this project I will use an iterative System Development Life-Cycle to create a reaction test desktop application that will test reaction speed for observing a change in colour of an area of the presented screen. It can be considered an evolutionary lifecycle approach. This system will evolve through early prototyping. We will have a functional product very early on, enhancements are delivered through frequent releases. This makes prioritisation and acceptance of new ideas flexible to accommodate changing ideas and needs. This approach ensures frequent collaboration with end-users.

Two user personas have been attributed to this idea:
